Disruptor Market
Disruptor-Market is a College Marketplace created to help those in the College connect and sell products without the need for an external Site.

Landing Page:

Landing Image []

UX:
Wireframe []

Mobile Wireframe []

These are the wireframes for both Desktop and Mobile View, we strived to make them as accurate as possible on the deployed Website.

Colour Palette Img #

The Colours were picked to be easy on the eyes and not too flashy, making a good contrast between text and background, enhancing readability. The site is also built to be simple and easy to navigate, also making it easy for users to list there Products.

Database Diagram []

This was made using https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ and was designed to fit the MVP.

The navbar is clear at the top making each option easily accessible to users. There is also a Search function that encourages users to directly search for items, and also categories to help them navigate to areas of interest. The Design is made to hit the MVP, but the Minimalistic Design works in the websites favour as it doesn't show an overwhelming amount of information on the first view, helping to avoid decision fatigue.
